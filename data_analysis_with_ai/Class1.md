## Hands-on activities and prompts:

### 1. Icebreaker with AI Insights
- For the mammographic_masses_nominal dataset, prompt AI as follows:

  - “Here is a dataset of mammographies. Can you tell me 3 surprising insights?”

- Which insights came from AI? Which are real? What’s your overall assessment of the result?

### 2. Analyzing Visuals with AI
- For the image file `Class01_FromGoodtoBadPractices_Pictures.png`, use the AI tools to analyze the quality and choice of the visuals presented in the file. You may want to try Grok.com as well!

  - “I want you to act as a data analyst and analyze the attached visuals in the search for improvements or better ways of visualizing the data.”

- How do you compare the AI analysis with the one performed by your group?
