# Data Analysis with AI (DA2I)

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Data Analysis with AI" (DA2I) training led by Dr. Leandro Nunes de Castro at Florida Gulf Coast University. This course is designed to introduce you to the core principles of data analysis and demonstrate how artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance every stage of the data analysis process, from summarizing and visualizing data to developing compelling data stories and dashboards.

Throughout the training, you will:
- Explore the fundamentals of data analysis and AI-enhanced techniques.
- Gain practical experience with leading AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude.ai, and Perplexity, learning how they can assist in summarizing, interpreting, and visualizing data.
- Understand the main careers in data science and the skills required for each role, including data analyst, data scientist, machine learning engineer, and more.
- Learn best practices in data storytelling, dashboard design, and prompt engineering to extract and communicate insights effectively.
- Discuss important topics such as the limitations, ethics, and accuracy of AI-generated outputs.

No programming experience is required. The focus is on building your ability to extract business-oriented insights, visualize relationships, and tell impactful stories with data, both with and without AI. By the end of this course, you will be equipped to apply AI-augmented workflows to real-world data projects and contribute to a data-driven culture in any organization.
