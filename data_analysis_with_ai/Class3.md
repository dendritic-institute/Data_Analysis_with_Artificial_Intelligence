# Class 3: Data Visualization and Design Principles

This class focuses on the visualization of data, covering distributions, associations, proportions, trends, and geospatial analysis. It introduces key design principles for effective data visualization and shows how AI can assist in creating impactful visual representations to uncover insights and communicate findings clearly.

## Hands-on activities and prompts:

### 1. Boxplot and Violin Plot with AI
```
Generate the boxplot and the violin plot for the iris dataset of Fisher.
```

### 2. Bubble Chart with AI
```
Generate a bubble chart for the gapminder dataset attached having variable ‘HDI Index’ in the x-axis, variable 'Life Expectancy' on the y-axis, variable ‘co2_consump’ as the bubble size, and variable 'continent' as the bubble color.
```
```
Generate a bubble chart for the mpg dataset attached having variable 'Acceleration' in the x-axis, variable 'MPG' on the y-axis, variable 'horsepower' as the bubble size, and variable 'cylinders' as the bubble color.
```

### 3. Scatterplot Matrix and Heatmap with AI
```
Generate the scatterplot matrix and correlation heatmap for the attached Iris dataset of Fisher
```

### 4. Bar Charts with AI
```
Generate the following visuals for the mammographic mass dataset:
1) A bar chart having the bars combining variables 'shape' and 'severity'.
2) A grouped bar chart for variable 'shape' by 'severity'.
3) A bar chart with the count of each category for variable 'severity'.
```

### 5. Pie and Doughnut Charts, and Treemap
```
Plot a pie chart, a doughnut chart, and a bar chart for variable 'margin' of the mammographic dataset.
```
```
For the attached gapminder_data_graphs dataset plot a treemap of the global GDP by Country and Continent for values greater than 5% per continent.
```

### 6. Line, Sankey, and Gantt Charts with AI
```
Generate a line chart with the 'life expectancy' by 'continent' over time for the Gapminder dataset.
```
```
Create a Sankey chart for a potential career path at an American university
```
```
Create a Gantt chart for a hypothetical project on the building of a house
```

### 7. Choropleth and Bubble Maps with AI
```
Create some choropleth and bubble maps with the Gapminder dataset.
```
